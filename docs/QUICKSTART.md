### Step 2: Create Your First ETL Flow

1. **Drag** a üì• Data Input block to the canvas
2. **Double-click** the block
3. **Select** `../examples/sample-data.csv` (or your own CSV)
4. **Click** the üëÅÔ∏è Data View button in the top-right corner to see your data!
5. **Alternative**: Use **Shift+Double-click** on the Data Input block for quick preview

### That's It! üéâ

You now have data loaded and can view it:
- ‚úÖ Loads CSV data
- ‚úÖ View with the Data View button (top-right)
- ‚úÖ Or use Shift+Double-click for quick preview

## Common Tasks

### Load Your Own Data
- Any CSV file works
- First row must be headers
- Use comma (`,`) as delimiter

### Move Blocks
- Click and drag any block to reposition

### Delete Blocks
- Click the ‚úï in the top-right corner

### View More Examples
- Open `../examples/example-flow.html` for a pre-configured demo
- Open `../examples/demo.html` for the full demo page

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Blocks won't drag
**Solution**: Make sure you're dragging from the toolbox, not the title

**Problem**: Can't connect blocks
**Solution**: Always drag FROM the bottom connector TO the top connector

**Problem**: No data showing
**Solution**: Make sure blocks are connected and Data Input has data loaded

## Next Steps

1. Try loading your own SAP CSV data
2. Create multiple flows
3. Experiment with the interface
