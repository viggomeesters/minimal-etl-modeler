# Automapper Unmapped Columns Fix - Summary

## Problem
When the Automapper block successfully mapped 6 out of 9 input columns, the 3 unmapped input columns were lost. Users had no way to send these unmapped columns to downstream blocks for manual mapping, editing, or further processing.

## Solution
The Automapper now passes through unmapped input columns along with the mapped columns. This allows users to:
1. Apply automatic mappings for columns that match well
2. Manually map the remaining unmapped columns in downstream Mapping blocks
3. Preserve all input data throughout the ETL pipeline

## What Changed

### Code Changes
1. **`applyMappingTransformation` function** - Enhanced to optionally include unmapped columns
2. **`applyAutomapper` function** - Now passes unmapped columns through by default
3. **UI messaging** - Changed from warning to informative message about passthrough

### User Experience Changes
- **Before**: Unmapped columns shown in yellow warning box → Lost when applied
- **After**: Unmapped columns shown in green info box → Passed through to next block

### Example
**Input Data**: 9 columns (Material_Number, Material_Description, Plant, Storage_Location, Batch, Quantity, Unit, Created_By, Created_Date)

**Target Template**: 6 columns (MaterialNumber, MaterialDesc, PlantCode, StorageLoc, Quantity, Unit)

**Automapper Result**:
- ✅ Automatically maps 6 columns
- ✅ Passes through 3 unmapped columns (Batch, Created_By, Created_Date)

**Next Step**: User can connect a Mapping block to manually map the 3 unmapped columns

## Benefits
1. **No Data Loss**: All input columns are preserved
2. **Flexible Workflow**: Auto-map what's possible, manually map the rest
3. **Better UX**: Clear communication about what happens to unmapped columns
4. **Backward Compatible**: Existing workflows continue to work

## Testing
- 44 total tests, all passing
- 13 new tests specifically for unmapped columns functionality
- Integration tests cover realistic SAP scenarios
- Security scan: 0 vulnerabilities

## Usage
No changes needed to your workflow! The Automapper will automatically:
1. Map columns it can match
2. Pass through columns it cannot match
3. Show you which columns are passed through
4. Allow you to manually map them in a downstream Mapping block

## Technical Details
- New parameter: `includeUnmapped` in `applyMappingTransformation()` (default: false for backward compatibility)
- Automapper calls with `includeUnmapped=true` to enable passthrough
- Unmapped columns are included in the output headers and data
- Block status shows: "X mapped, Y passthrough" when there are unmapped columns

## Files Changed
- `app.js` - Core functionality updates
- `test-unmapped-columns.js` - Unit tests (new)
- `test-automapper-unmapped-integration.js` - Integration tests (new)
- Test CSV files for validation (new)

## Migration Guide
No migration needed! This is a backward-compatible enhancement. Existing flows will work exactly as before, but now with the added benefit of preserving unmapped columns.
