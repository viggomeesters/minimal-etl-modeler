# Output Directory

This directory is for storing exported data files from the ETL Modeler.

## Usage

When you export data using the **Output Data** block or **Rejected Output** block, save your files here to keep them organized.

## Supported Formats

- CSV files (`.csv`)
- Excel files (`.xlsx`)

## Note

Files in this directory are ignored by git (see `.gitignore`), so your exported data remains local and private.
